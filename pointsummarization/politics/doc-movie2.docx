Two former intelligence chiefs blast Trump over Russia comments

Washington (CNN)A pair of former US intelligence chiefs blasted President Donald Trump Sunday after he attacked them a day earlier while discussing his recent conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday on CNN"s "State of the Union" that Trump's downplaying of the threat posed by Russia's meddling in last year's election was dangerous to US national security and allows countries like Russia and China to "play" the President. Former CIA Director John Brennan said Trump is allowing Putin to get away with Russia's efforts to disrupt the presidential election.
Speaking alongside Brennan, Clapper said: "The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country."
Clapper, a CNN analyst, was responding to Trump's mixed comments about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.
'Giving Putin a pass'
Brennan said Trump was in effect "giving Putin a pass," which invited other countries to seek to sway Trump.
Clapper concurred, saying, "I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him."
Brennan said Putin's apparent success with Trump was due to his use of flattery and Brennan's suspicion that Trump "for whatever reason" might be "intimidated" by Putin.
"It's either naiveté, ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-a-vis the Russians," Brennan said.
President clarifies his Saturday statement on believing Putin
Trump, while speaking Sunday at a news conference in Hanoi, sought to clarify remarks he made a day earlier that suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin was being sincere in his denials that Moscow engaged in election meddling.
The President stressed he was not accepting Putin's denials at face value, instead saying he merely believed Putin was being genuine.
"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said. "As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership."
But he again stopped short of stating explicitly that Russia was behind the interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence has determined was conducted to help Trump.
Trump on Saturday also dismissed former officials like Clapper, Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey as "political hacks."
The intelligence community released an unclassified version of its assessment in January, saying Putin ordered the election meddling to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy and bolster Trump's successful bid. Putin denies the accusations, and Trump has wavered publicly on his own stance.
Brennan said he considered Trump's attack on them as an attempt to undermine the credibility of that intelligence community report, which the former CIA director noted was written by intelligence and law enforcement officers, not himself, Clapper or Comey.
"He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment," Brennan said.
The Obama-era CIA chief added that he took the criticism from Trump with pride.
"Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor," Brennan said.
Asked about his own knowledge of any potential collusion between Trump's associates and Russia, Brennan demurred, saying he had spoken with the congressional investigators, and went on later in the interview to praise former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is leading the special counsel investigation.
Clapper said that although he had "no direct evidence of collusion" while still on the job, he did not know about former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos' activities, which were revealed last month in unsealed court documents. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with a foreign contact close to the Russian government.
Since leaving government, Clapper said more information had come out that raises at least "circumstantial questions" about potential connections between Trump's associates and Russia

GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations


The chief fundraising committee for Senate Republicans on Friday severed ties with Alabama candidate Roy Moore, following allegations by four women that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens.
The allegations were first reported by The Washington Post, and Moore has since come under intense pressure to step aside in the Dec. 12 special election.
Moore has denied the claims, calling them politically motivated "garbage."

The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.
The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers. At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.
According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.
Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."
In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.
Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.
As of 2 p.m. ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.

Trump meets with Philippine president, has brief discussion on human rights


President Trump prepared to wrap up his 12-day trip to Asia on Monday by attending an economic conference in the Philippines, including a meeting with its controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte, that touched only briefly on human rights.
The two leaders focused on fighting the Islamic State, drug trafficking, and trade issues, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, adding: "Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs."
Trump did not say publicly whether he would bring up the series of extra-judicial killings that have marked the Philippines' war on drugs, instead telling Duterte in remarks to reporters that "we've had a great relationship" and "this has been very successful."
Duterte, who has bragged about personally killing people as part of his anti-drug effort, returned the pleasantries, telling Trump he was looking forward to discussing issues of mutual concern.
In addition to Duterte and other meetings at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, Trump teased the approaching end of his trip by telling reporters he would have a "major announcement" Wednesday back at the White House on the two issues that topped the Asia agenda: trade and North Korea.
"We've made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know, in addition to about $300 billion in additional sales to various companies, including China," Trump said during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
When reporters at the Duterte meeting asked Trump if he raised human rights issues behind closed doors, the Philippines president shut them down by saying it was not a news conference.
Duterte also described reporters as "spies," drawing a laugh from Trump.
Human rights groups have assailed Duterte for his administration of the Philippines and implementing a war on drugs that includes extrajudicial killings, some of which Duterte has claimed to have participated in.
At a summit session later, Trump praised "Rodrigo" for his role in chairing ASEAN meetings, and for his "incredible hospitality" in general.
“And the show last night ... the talent at that show, I assume mostly from the Philippines, was fantastic," Trump said. "And you were fantastic – also very much from the Philippines. We couldn’t tell the difference.”
After thanking Trump, Duterte said, "this signifies the end of our open session. I would like to request media to leave us alone.” 
Hours before his scheduled bilateral meeting with Duterte, Trump also participated in a photo opportunity with the Philippine leader in his role as host of the ASEAN summit.
As an orchestra played a stately processional in a Manila auditorium, the ASEAN delegates lined up for a special group handshake, with Trump standing next to Duterte. Trump appeared to have some difficulty figuring out how to do the crossed-arm maneuver. Soon, he caught on
Duterte did not specifically discuss his government's efforts in a statement opening the ASEAN conference, but told those gathered that the "the menace of the illegal drug trade continues to threaten the fabric of our societies."
The host also talked about the Philippines' military actions against the Islamic State.
“I apologize for setting the tone of statement in such a manner,” he said, but “these threats know no boundaries.”
Then-president Barack Obama criticized Duterte over his drug war, and the two never met.
Trump has been more conciliatory toward the Philippine strongman. After an April phone call between Trump and Duterte, a White House statement said the Philippines is “fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.”
In addition to the summit and the Duterte meeting, Trump is holding a series of meetings with allies, including Turnbull, Abe, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
During the session with Trumbull and Abe, Trump talked about efforts to reduce trade deficits with other countries.
Trump also said "this has been a very fruitful trip for us," one in which he has asked other countries to put an economic squeeze on North Korea, trying to pressure Kim Jong Un's government to give up nuclear weapons.
The president also praised the way other countries have treated him.
"Red carpet like I think probably nobody has ever received," Trump said. "That really is a sense of respect, perhaps for me a little bit, but really for our country, and I'm very proud of that."
The leaders of the United States, Australia and Japan all said North Korea is a primary focus,
"For the three of us," Abe said, "the immediate challenge is North Korea."
Turnbull said, "We've got the same values and the same focus — insuring that the North Korean regime comes to its senses and stops its reckless provocations and threats of conflict on our region."
The Australian prime minister is the leader Trump clashed with during a phone call placed the first weekend of his administration back in January. Trump complained about a refugee agreement that the Obama administration had reached with Australia.
Monday was supposed to have been the final day of the Asia trip for which Trump left the White House on Nov. 3.
Trump  extended the trip by a day to attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines on Tuesday. The administration had been criticized for planning to skip the event at a time when China is trying to increase its influence in the region.
The Asia trip, coming a year after his Election Day win, has taken Trump to Japan, South Korea and China. His focus has been on changing global trade rules and lobbying other countries over North Korea.
Trump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an economic summit in Vietnam; that session sparked more arguments over a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election.

Modi govt. has no option but to change GST rates: Chidambaram


A “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST Council in Guwahati today, he says.
Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Friday said a “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council in Guwahati on Friday.
The “panic-stricken” Modi government would be forced to heed the advice of the Opposition and experts due to the coming Gujarat Assembly elections, he said in tweets.
A letter from the Finance Ministers of the Congress-ruled States to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who heads the Council, would set the tone for discussions in the meeting. “The letter exposes the structural flaws in the design and implementation of GST. The government can no longer duck these issues,” he said.
The government had avoided debate and voting in Rajya Sabha on GST Bills but it cannot avoid a debate in the public domain or in the GST Council. “Congress Finance Ministers will force changes in GST Council meeting. Agra, Surat, Tiruppur and other hub towns are watching,” he said.
Last week, the Ministers demanded a major overhaul of GST, alleging that the tax reform measure had turned out to be a “big disappointment” due to its “poor” implementation with regard to GST’s concept, design, tax rates, exemptions, compliance requirement and technological preparedness.
The Ministers from Punjab and Karnataka, Manpreet Badal and Krishna Gowda, alleged that the country had “lost the opportunity” to bring tax reform and that there was “utter chaos and confusion”, forcing many businesses to shut down.
They said the party would demand reduction of tax rates for many items and raise other concerns of the business community in the Guwahati meeting

The intelligence community released an unclassified version of its assessment in January, saying Putin ordered the election meddling to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy and bolster Trump's successful bid. Putin denies the accusations, and Trump has wavered publicly on his own stance.
Brennan said he considered Trump's attack on them as an attempt to undermine the credibility of that intelligence community report, which the former CIA director noted was written by intelligence and law enforcement officers, not himself, Clapper or Comey.
"He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment," Brennan said.
The Obama-era CIA chief added that he took the criticism from Trump with pride.
"Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor," Brennan said.
Asked about his own knowledge of any potential collusion between Trump's associates and Russia, Brennan demurred, saying he had spoken with the congressional investigators, and went on later in the interview to praise former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is leading the special counsel investigation.
Clapper said that although he had "no direct evidence of collusion" while still on the job, he did not know about former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos' activities, which were revealed last month in unsealed court documents. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with a foreign contact close to the Russian government.
Since leaving government, Clapper said more information had come out that raises at least "circumstantial questions" about potential connections between Trump's associates and Russia

GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations


The chief fundraising committee for Senate Republicans on Friday severed ties with Alabama candidate Roy Moore, following allegations by four women that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens.
The allegations were first reported by The Washington Post, and Moore has since come under intense pressure to step aside in the Dec. 12 special election.
Moore has denied the claims, calling them politically motivated "garbage."

The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.
The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers. At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.
According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.
Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."
In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.
Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.
As of 2 p.m. ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.

Trump meets with Philippine president, has brief discussion on human rights


President Trump prepared to wrap up his 12-day trip to Asia on Monday by attending an economic conference in the Philippines, including a meeting with its controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte, that touched only briefly on human rights.
The two leaders focused on fighting the Islamic State, drug trafficking, and trade issues, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, adding: "Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs."
Trump did not say publicly whether he would bring up the series of extra-judicial killings that have marked the Philippines' war on drugs, instead telling Duterte in remarks to reporters that "we've had a great relationship" and "this has been very successful."
Duterte, who has bragged about personally killing people as part of his anti-drug effort, returned the pleasantries, telling Trump he was looking forward to discussing issues of mutual concern.
In addition to Duterte and other meetings at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, Trump teased the approaching end of his trip by telling reporters he would have a "major announcement" Wednesday back at the White House on the two issues that topped the Asia agenda: trade and North Korea.
"We've made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know, in addition to about $300 billion in additional sales to various companies, including China," Trump said during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
When reporters at the Duterte meeting asked Trump if he raised human rights issues behind closed doors, the Philippines president shut them down by saying it was not a news conference.
Duterte also described reporters as "spies," drawing a laugh from Trump.
Human rights groups have assailed Duterte for his administration of the Philippines and implementing a war on drugs that includes extrajudicial killings, some of which Duterte has claimed to have participated in.
At a summit session later, Trump praised "Rodrigo" for his role in chairing ASEAN meetings, and for his "incredible hospitality" in general.
“And the show last night ... the talent at that show, I assume mostly from the Philippines, was fantastic," Trump said. "And you were fantastic – also very much from the Philippines. We couldn’t tell the difference.”
After thanking Trump, Duterte said, "this signifies the end of our open session. I would like to request media to leave us alone.” 
Hours before his scheduled bilateral meeting with Duterte, Trump also participated in a photo opportunity with the Philippine leader in his role as host of the ASEAN summit.
As an orchestra played a stately processional in a Manila auditorium, the ASEAN delegates lined up for a special group handshake, with Trump standing next to Duterte. Trump appeared to have some difficulty figuring out how to do the crossed-arm maneuver. Soon, he caught on
Duterte did not specifically discuss his government's efforts in a statement opening the ASEAN conference, but told those gathered that the "the menace of the illegal drug trade continues to threaten the fabric of our societies."
The host also talked about the Philippines' military actions against the Islamic State.
“I apologize for setting the tone of statement in such a manner,” he said, but “these threats know no boundaries.”
Then-president Barack Obama criticized Duterte over his drug war, and the two never met.
Trump has been more conciliatory toward the Philippine strongman. After an April phone call between Trump and Duterte, a White House statement said the Philippines is “fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.”
In addition to the summit and the Duterte meeting, Trump is holding a series of meetings with allies, including Turnbull, Abe, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
During the session with Trumbull and Abe, Trump talked about efforts to reduce trade deficits with other countries.
Trump also said "this has been a very fruitful trip for us," one in which he has asked other countries to put an economic squeeze on North Korea, trying to pressure Kim Jong Un's government to give up nuclear weapons.
The president also praised the way other countries have treated him.
"Red carpet like I think probably nobody has ever received," Trump said. "That really is a sense of respect, perhaps for me a little bit, but really for our country, and I'm very proud of that."
The leaders of the United States, Australia and Japan all said North Korea is a primary focus,
"For the three of us," Abe said, "the immediate challenge is North Korea."
Turnbull said, "We've got the same values and the same focus — insuring that the North Korean regime comes to its senses and stops its reckless provocations and threats of conflict on our region."
The Australian prime minister is the leader Trump clashed with during a phone call placed the first weekend of his administration back in January. Trump complained about a refugee agreement that the Obama administration had reached with Australia.
Monday was supposed to have been the final day of the Asia trip for which Trump left the White House on Nov. 3.
Trump  extended the trip by a day to attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines on Tuesday. The administration had been criticized for planning to skip the event at a time when China is trying to increase its influence in the region.
The Asia trip, coming a year after his Election Day win, has taken Trump to Japan, South Korea and China. His focus has been on changing global trade rules and lobbying other countries over North Korea.
Trump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an economic summit in Vietnam; that session sparked more arguments over a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election.


Modi govt. has no option but to change GST rates: Chidambaram


A “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST Council in Guwahati today, he says.
Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Friday said a “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council in Guwahati on Friday.
The “panic-stricken” Modi government would be forced to heed the advice of the Opposition and experts due to the coming Gujarat Assembly elections, he said in tweets.
A letter from the Finance Ministers of the Congress-ruled States to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who heads the Council, would set the tone for discussions in the meeting. “The letter exposes the structural flaws in the design and implementation of GST. The government can no longer duck these issues,” he said.
The government had avoided debate and voting in Rajya Sabha on GST Bills but it cannot avoid a debate in the public domain or in the GST Council. “Congress Finance Ministers will force changes in GST Council meeting. Agra, Surat, Tiruppur and other hub towns are watching,” he said.
Last week, the Ministers demanded a major overhaul of GST, alleging that the tax reform measure had turned out to be a “big disappointment” due to its “poor” implementation with regard to GST’s concept, design, tax rates, exemptions, compliance requirement and technological preparedness.
The Ministers from Punjab and Karnataka, Manpreet Badal and Krishna Gowda, alleged that the country had “lost the opportunity” to bring tax reform and that there was “utter chaos and confusion”, forcing many businesses to shut down.
They said the party would demand reduction of tax rates for many items and raise other concerns of the business community in the Guwahati meeting

Rajiv Gandhi was ‘entrepreneur’ for Swedish jet, U.S. cable says



Revelation contained in Kissinger-era documents obtained by WikiLeaks
Much before he became Prime Minister, during his years as an Indian Airlines pilot, Rajiv Gandhi may have been a middleman for the Swedish company Saab-Scania, when it was trying to sell its Viggen fighter aircraft to India in the 1970s.
The astonishing revelation that he was the “main Indian negotiator” for a massive aircraft deal for which his “family” connections were seen as valuable, is contained in the Kissinger Cables, the latest tranche of U.S diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks and accessed by The Hindu as part of an investigative collaboration. The cables will be released on Monday.
The British SEPECAT Jaguar eventually won the race, from which Saab was forced to withdraw by the U.S.
Rajiv Gandhi, who kept away from politics until he was pushed into it by his mother Indira after the death of his brother Sanjay in 1980, came into public life with a squeaky clean image. Years later, a controversy over bribes paid in another military deal with a different Swedish company, Bofors, was to lead to Rajiv’s and the Congress’s defeat in the 1989 elections.
A series of 41 cables between 1974 and 1976 give glimpses into the “fighter sweepstakes” in India, with one wryly observing that the Swedish company had “understood the importance of family influences in the final decision in the fighter sweepstakes.”
Dassault, the French aircraft maker, too had figured this out. According to the cable, their negotiator for the Mirage fighter aircraft was the son-in-law of Air Marshal O.P. Mehra, then Air Chief.
An October 21, 1975 cable from the New Delhi U.S. Embassy (>1975NEWDE14031_b, confidential) details information given to it by a diplomat in the Swedish Embassy. “Mrs Gandhi’s oler [sic] son’s only association with the aircraft industry (to our knowledge) has been as a pilot for Indian Airlines and this is the first time we have heard his name as entrepreneur.”
Having noted what the Swedes had said, the cable makes the comment that there was no additional information to either refute or confirm the information.
The cable goes on to say, “Mrs Gandhi (according to the Swedish info) has made the personal decision not to purchase the British Jaguar because of her prejudices against the British. The decision would be between the Mirage [Dassault Mirage F1] and the Viggen.”
Importance of ‘family’
In another cable ( >1976NEWDE01909_b, confidential), the Swedes also made it clear they “understood the importance of family influences” in the final decision. The cable adds: “Our colleague describes Ranjiv Gandhi [sic] in flattering terms, and contends his technical expertise is of a high level. This may or may not be. Offhand, we would have thought a transport pilot [is] not the best expert to rely upon in evaluating a fighter plane, but then we are speaking of a transport pilot who has another and perhaps more relevant qualification.”
The first cable adds that Air Marshal Mehra’s son-in-law was the chief negotiator for the competing Mirage, but it does not give his name.
Contacted in New Delhi, Navin Behl, the former Air Chief’s son-in-law, denied that he was ever involved in any such negotiations. “I was never an arms dealer. We’ve got nothing to do with it. I am a chartered accountant, [I was] practising then [in the 1970s], and now we're in the manufacture and export of home furnishings,” he told The Hindu.
The Swedish diplomat quoted in this cable said his country’s neutral position in world politics was offsetting the Viggen’s higher cost. The cable also records the official’s “irritation at the way Mrs Gandhi is personally dominating negotiations, without [the] involvement of Indian Air Force officers. According to him, negotiations with the Swedes are for 50 Viggen aircraft to be delivered at $4-5 million per aircraft with the Swedes believing that the Indians have made the decision not to purchase any more Soviet military aircraft.”
U.S. blocks deal
But Sweden had to do an abrupt about turn with what appears to be a bit of arm-twisting. An August 6, 1976 cable ( >1976STOCKH04230_b, secret) titled “Saab-Scania requests for U.S. permission to export Viggen and license to India” appears to confirm this with a blunt message: “The USG, after careful consideration, has concluded that no version of the Viggen containing any classified U.S. components would be acceptable for transfer to India. It would also oppose any transfer to India, for local production, of the advanced U.S. technology represented in the Viggen’s aerodynamic design, engine and flying controls, navigation system, electronic components and weapons systems.”
Another 1976 cable ( >1976STOCKH04231_b, secret) details the negative USG response to Saab-Scania president Curt Mileikowsky’s informal request for export of Viggen aircraft to India and licence to manufacture such aircraft to India. Senior Swedish officials have also emphasised “that [the] most important consideration to their government was preservation of cooperation with the U.S. on military R&D, which they recognised as vital to maintenance of a viable Swedish defence effort and that the sale of the Viggen to India was of secondary consideration to them in comparison with the value of military cooperation with the U.S.”
Scramble for contract
The earliest reference to the IAF upgrade plan is in a 1974 cable (>1974LONDON00554_b, secret), which elaborates how the Indians had nearly completed negotiations for two Navy Corvettes and an unspecified number of Jaguar aircraft, though negotiations temporarily stalled because of the oil crisis.
India, according to the FCO South Asian Department head, had “expressed desire for [a] modest alternative to the Soviets as an arms supply source, and had begun discussions with the British early last summer.” The British were smelling a deal “in the neighbourhood of 30-35 million pounds, probably only the first tranche of an ongoing program which could reach 100-120 million pounds over a period of time.”
The Viggen pitch to India was of immense interest to the U.S. As one cable (>1975STATE270066_b, secret) said, the aircraft “contains a large number of parts and components of U.S. origin which are therefore subject to USG control in third-party sales.”
Jaguar, meanwhile, was aggressively in the hunt. A November 19, 1975 cable (>1975NEWDE15350_b, confidential), said: “London has now decided to offer the Government Of India a more favorable financing arrangement, 71/4 percent over five years, than was earlier the case. The GOI has asked for two percent over 15 years, but the British tell us this is impossible. The GOI still wants 40 aircraft to be delivered within 36 months. The original British offer was 60 months, but they are now talking in terms of 40 odd months.” The cable ends by saying that the final decision was expected to be political and made by the Prime Minister.
Another cable ( >1975PARIS33184_b confidential) details French concern that “Mrs Gandhi’s advance toward dictatorship is now irreversible, and that French Prime Minister Chirac was unhappy with the idea of appearing to condone this development through his official visit” but also nursed the hope that the visit would be able to improve sales prospects for the Mirage F-1.
By the next year, the French Embassy is convinced ( >1976NEWDE00845_b, confidential) that it is Prime Minister [Indira] Gandhi alone who will make the final decision, and it will be on political grounds. The Swedes are also pushing their product. The French believed that the Swedes had dropped their price and offered to take rupees in payment. They were seen as moving towards delivering the first 24 to 36 aircraft to India, with the next aircraft being assembled in India under licence.

Two former intelligence chiefs blast Trump over Russia comments

Washington (CNN)A pair of former US intelligence chiefs blasted President Donald Trump Sunday after he attacked them a day earlier while discussing his recent conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday on CNN"s "State of the Union" that Trump's downplaying of the threat posed by Russia's meddling in last year's election was dangerous to US national security and allows countries like Russia and China to "play" the President. Former CIA Director John Brennan said Trump is allowing Putin to get away with Russia's efforts to disrupt the presidential election.
Speaking alongside Brennan, Clapper said: "The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country."
Clapper, a CNN analyst, was responding to Trump's mixed comments about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.
'Giving Putin a pass'
Brennan said Trump was in effect "giving Putin a pass," which invited other countries to seek to sway Trump.
Clapper concurred, saying, "I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him."
Brennan said Putin's apparent success with Trump was due to his use of flattery and Brennan's suspicion that Trump "for whatever reason" might be "intimidated" by Putin.
"It's either naiveté, ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-a-vis the Russians," Brennan said.
President clarifies his Saturday statement on believing Putin
Trump, while speaking Sunday at a news conference in Hanoi, sought to clarify remarks he made a day earlier that suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin was being sincere in his denials that Moscow engaged in election meddling.
The President stressed he was not accepting Putin's denials at face value, instead saying he merely believed Putin was being genuine.
"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said. "As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership."
But he again stopped short of stating explicitly that Russia was behind the interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence has determined was conducted to help Trump.
Trump on Saturday also dismissed former officials like Clapper, Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey as "political hacks."

According to him, negotiations with the Swedes are for 50 Viggen aircraft to be delivered at $4-5 million per aircraft with the Swedes believing that the Indians have made the decision not to purchase any more Soviet military aircraft.”
U.S. blocks deal
But Sweden had to do an abrupt about turn with what appears to be a bit of arm-twisting. An August 6, 1976 cable ( >1976STOCKH04230_b, secret) titled “Saab-Scania requests for U.S. permission to export Viggen and license to India” appears to confirm this with a blunt message: “The USG, after careful consideration, has concluded that no version of the Viggen containing any classified U.S. components would be acceptable for transfer to India. It would also oppose any transfer to India, for local production, of the advanced U.S. technology represented in the Viggen’s aerodynamic design, engine and flying controls, navigation system, electronic components and weapons systems.”
Another 1976 cable ( >1976STOCKH04231_b, secret) details the negative USG response to Saab-Scania president Curt Mileikowsky’s informal request for export of Viggen aircraft to India and licence to manufacture such aircraft to India. Senior Swedish officials have also emphasised “that [the] most important consideration to their government was preservation of cooperation with the U.S. on military R&D, which they recognised as vital to maintenance of a viable Swedish defence effort and that the sale of the Viggen to India was of secondary consideration to them in comparison with the value of military cooperation with the U.S.”
Scramble for contract
The earliest reference to the IAF upgrade plan is in a 1974 cable (>1974LONDON00554_b, secret), which elaborates how the Indians had nearly completed negotiations for two Navy Corvettes and an unspecified number of Jaguar aircraft, though negotiations temporarily stalled because of the oil crisis.
India, according to the FCO South Asian Department head, had “expressed desire for [a] modest alternative to the Soviets as an arms supply source, and had begun discussions with the British early last summer.” The British were smelling a deal “in the neighbourhood of 30-35 million pounds, probably only the first tranche of an ongoing program which could reach 100-120 million pounds over a period of time.”
The Viggen pitch to India was of immense interest to the U.S. As one cable (>1975STATE270066_b, secret) said, the aircraft “contains a large number of parts and components of U.S. origin which are therefore subject to USG control in third-party sales.”
Jaguar, meanwhile, was aggressively in the hunt. A November 19, 1975 cable (>1975NEWDE15350_b, confidential), said: “London has now decided to offer the Government Of India a more favorable financing arrangement, 71/4 percent over five years, than was earlier the case. The GOI has asked for two percent over 15 years, but the British tell us this is impossible. The GOI still wants 40 aircraft to be delivered within 36 months. The original British offer was 60 months, but they are now talking in terms of 40 odd months.” The cable ends by saying that the final decision was expected to be political and made by the Prime Minister.
Another cable ( >1975PARIS33184_b confidential) details French concern that “Mrs Gandhi’s advance toward dictatorship is now irreversible, and that French Prime Minister Chirac was unhappy with the idea of appearing to condone this development through his official visit” but also nursed the hope that the visit would be able to improve sales prospects for the Mirage F-1.
By the next year, the French Embassy is convinced ( >1976NEWDE00845_b, confidential) that it is Prime Minister [Indira] Gandhi alone who will make the final decision, and it will be on political grounds. The Swedes are also pushing their product. The French believed that the Swedes had dropped their price and offered to take rupees in payment. They were seen as moving towards delivering the first 24 to 36 aircraft to India, with the next aircraft being assembled in India under licence.

Review: 'The Machine' conjures a stylish sense of wonder, danger



A resourcefully stylish indie sci-fi entry from Britain, "The Machine" drapes sleek visuals over an artificial intelligence tale set in a top-secret British government facility where robots are being developed to fight a cold war with China.
Empathic computer genius Vincent (Toby Stephens) has more on his mind, however, than creating a weapon-strength, self-aware being for his military boss (Denis Lawson). Vincent imagines a revolutionary future in which the brain-damaged (be they wounded soldiers or his medically afflicted daughter) are given their humanity again.
That makes Vincent's breakthrough — the Machine (Caity Lotz), an aerodynamic hot bod of a robot who can flip, fight and care deeply — into a moral battleground of sorts. With her slick-backed hair, Lotz is a cyberblond right out of Hitchcock's dystopian fantasies.
Writer-director Caradog W. James is so enamored by the coolly designed future aesthetics of movies like "A Clockwork Orange" and "Blade Runner" that his metaphoric dark-and-darker lighting can get the best of him. (Being able to see an actor's face has been known to be effective.) But even with a cut-and-dried approach to characterization and the issue of man-made consciousness, "The Machine" percolates with an elegantly palpable sense of wonder and danger.
