Two former intelligence chiefs blast Trump over Russia comments

Washington (CNN)A pair of former US intelligence chiefs blasted President Donald Trump Sunday after he attacked them a day earlier while discussing his recent conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday on CNN"s "State of the Union" that Trump's downplaying of the threat posed by Russia's meddling in last year's election was dangerous to US national security and allows countries like Russia and China to "play" the President. Former CIA Director John Brennan said Trump is allowing Putin to get away with Russia's efforts to disrupt the presidential election.
Speaking alongside Brennan, Clapper said: "The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country."
Clapper, a CNN analyst, was responding to Trump's mixed comments about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.
'Giving Putin a pass'
Brennan said Trump was in effect "giving Putin a pass," which invited other countries to seek to sway Trump.
Clapper concurred, saying, "I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him."
Brennan said Putin's apparent success with Trump was due to his use of flattery and Brennan's suspicion that Trump "for whatever reason" might be "intimidated" by Putin.
"It's either naiveté, ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-a-vis the Russians," Brennan said.
President clarifies his Saturday statement on believing Putin
Trump, while speaking Sunday at a news conference in Hanoi, sought to clarify remarks he made a day earlier that suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin was being sincere in his denials that Moscow engaged in election meddling.
The President stressed he was not accepting Putin's denials at face value, instead saying he merely believed Putin was being genuine.
"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump said. "As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership."
But he again stopped short of stating explicitly that Russia was behind the interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence has determined was conducted to help Trump.
Trump on Saturday also dismissed former officials like Clapper, Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey as "political hacks."
The intelligence community released an unclassified version of its assessment in January, saying Putin ordered the election meddling to hurt Hillary Clinton's candidacy and bolster Trump's successful bid. Putin denies the accusations, and Trump has wavered publicly on his own stance.
Brennan said he considered Trump's attack on them as an attempt to undermine the credibility of that intelligence community report, which the former CIA director noted was written by intelligence and law enforcement officers, not himself, Clapper or Comey.
"He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment," Brennan said.
The Obama-era CIA chief added that he took the criticism from Trump with pride.
"Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor," Brennan said.
Asked about his own knowledge of any potential collusion between Trump's associates and Russia, Brennan demurred, saying he had spoken with the congressional investigators, and went on later in the interview to praise former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is leading the special counsel investigation.
Clapper said that although he had "no direct evidence of collusion" while still on the job, he did not know about former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos' activities, which were revealed last month in unsealed court documents. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with a foreign contact close to the Russian government.
Since leaving government, Clapper said more information had come out that raises at least "circumstantial questions" about potential connections between Trump's associates and Russia

GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations


The chief fundraising committee for Senate Republicans on Friday severed ties with Alabama candidate Roy Moore, following allegations by four women that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens.
The allegations were first reported by The Washington Post, and Moore has since come under intense pressure to step aside in the Dec. 12 special election.
Moore has denied the claims, calling them politically motivated "garbage."

The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.
The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers. At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.
According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.
Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."
In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.
Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.
As of 2 p.m. ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.

Trump meets with Philippine president, has brief discussion on human rights


President Trump prepared to wrap up his 12-day trip to Asia on Monday by attending an economic conference in the Philippines, including a meeting with its controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte, that touched only briefly on human rights.
The two leaders focused on fighting the Islamic State, drug trafficking, and trade issues, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, adding: "Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs."
Trump did not say publicly whether he would bring up the series of extra-judicial killings that have marked the Philippines' war on drugs, instead telling Duterte in remarks to reporters that "we've had a great relationship" and "this has been very successful."
Duterte, who has bragged about personally killing people as part of his anti-drug effort, returned the pleasantries, telling Trump he was looking forward to discussing issues of mutual concern.
In addition to Duterte and other meetings at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, Trump teased the approaching end of his trip by telling reporters he would have a "major announcement" Wednesday back at the White House on the two issues that topped the Asia agenda: trade and North Korea.
"We've made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know, in addition to about $300 billion in additional sales to various companies, including China," Trump said during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
When reporters at the Duterte meeting asked Trump if he raised human rights issues behind closed doors, the Philippines president shut them down by saying it was not a news conference.
Duterte also described reporters as "spies," drawing a laugh from Trump.
Human rights groups have assailed Duterte for his administration of the Philippines and implementing a war on drugs that includes extrajudicial killings, some of which Duterte has claimed to have participated in.
At a summit session later, Trump praised "Rodrigo" for his role in chairing ASEAN meetings, and for his "incredible hospitality" in general.
“And the show last night ... the talent at that show, I assume mostly from the Philippines, was fantastic," Trump said. "And you were fantastic – also very much from the Philippines. We couldn’t tell the difference.”
After thanking Trump, Duterte said, "this signifies the end of our open session. I would like to request media to leave us alone.” 
Hours before his scheduled bilateral meeting with Duterte, Trump also participated in a photo opportunity with the Philippine leader in his role as host of the ASEAN summit.
As an orchestra played a stately processional in a Manila auditorium, the ASEAN delegates lined up for a special group handshake, with Trump standing next to Duterte. Trump appeared to have some difficulty figuring out how to do the crossed-arm maneuver. Soon, he caught on
Duterte did not specifically discuss his government's efforts in a statement opening the ASEAN conference, but told those gathered that the "the menace of the illegal drug trade continues to threaten the fabric of our societies."
The host also talked about the Philippines' military actions against the Islamic State.
“I apologize for setting the tone of statement in such a manner,” he said, but “these threats know no boundaries.”
Then-president Barack Obama criticized Duterte over his drug war, and the two never met.
Trump has been more conciliatory toward the Philippine strongman. After an April phone call between Trump and Duterte, a White House statement said the Philippines is “fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.”
In addition to the summit and the Duterte meeting, Trump is holding a series of meetings with allies, including Turnbull, Abe, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
During the session with Trumbull and Abe, Trump talked about efforts to reduce trade deficits with other countries.
Trump also said "this has been a very fruitful trip for us," one in which he has asked other countries to put an economic squeeze on North Korea, trying to pressure Kim Jong Un's government to give up nuclear weapons.
The president also praised the way other countries have treated him.
"Red carpet like I think probably nobody has ever received," Trump said. "That really is a sense of respect, perhaps for me a little bit, but really for our country, and I'm very proud of that."
The leaders of the United States, Australia and Japan all said North Korea is a primary focus,
"For the three of us," Abe said, "the immediate challenge is North Korea."
Turnbull said, "We've got the same values and the same focus — insuring that the North Korean regime comes to its senses and stops its reckless provocations and threats of conflict on our region."
The Australian prime minister is the leader Trump clashed with during a phone call placed the first weekend of his administration back in January. Trump complained about a refugee agreement that the Obama administration had reached with Australia.
Monday was supposed to have been the final day of the Asia trip for which Trump left the White House on Nov. 3.
Trump  extended the trip by a day to attend the East Asia Summit in the Philippines on Tuesday. The administration had been criticized for planning to skip the event at a time when China is trying to increase its influence in the region.
The Asia trip, coming a year after his Election Day win, has taken Trump to Japan, South Korea and China. His focus has been on changing global trade rules and lobbying other countries over North Korea.
Trump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at an economic summit in Vietnam; that session sparked more arguments over a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election.

Modi govt. has no option but to change GST rates: Chidambaram


A “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST Council in Guwahati today, he says.
Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Friday said a “shower of changes” is expected from a meeting of the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council in Guwahati on Friday.
The “panic-stricken” Modi government would be forced to heed the advice of the Opposition and experts due to the coming Gujarat Assembly elections, he said in tweets.
A letter from the Finance Ministers of the Congress-ruled States to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who heads the Council, would set the tone for discussions in the meeting. “The letter exposes the structural flaws in the design and implementation of GST. The government can no longer duck these issues,” he said.
The government had avoided debate and voting in Rajya Sabha on GST Bills but it cannot avoid a debate in the public domain or in the GST Council. “Congress Finance Ministers will force changes in GST Council meeting. Agra, Surat, Tiruppur and other hub towns are watching,” he said.
Last week, the Ministers demanded a major overhaul of GST, alleging that the tax reform measure had turned out to be a “big disappointment” due to its “poor” implementation with regard to GST’s concept, design, tax rates, exemptions, compliance requirement and technological preparedness.
The Ministers from Punjab and Karnataka, Manpreet Badal and Krishna Gowda, alleged that the country had “lost the opportunity” to bring tax reform and that there was “utter chaos and confusion”, forcing many businesses to shut down.
They said the party would demand reduction of tax rates for many items and raise other concerns of the business community in the Guwahati meeting
