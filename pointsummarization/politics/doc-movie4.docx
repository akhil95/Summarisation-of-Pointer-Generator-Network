Abstract


Nowadays, there is a huge amount of online reviews for almost every product and service.  These reviews have largely contributed to the growth of e-commerce; however in place of a human, extracting related information from this mass of re- views in order to create an easy to under- stand summarization is not a trivial matter. In this study, we present the SuRe system to produce a textual summarization from hotel free-text reviews as well as a prelim- inary evaluation.


1   Introduction

Nowadays, there is a huge amount of customer re- views available online for almost every product and service.  Commonly they are in the form of a short free-text, which contains not only general comments but also highly personal opinions or cir- cumstances. It would be a very valuable source of information for both the customers and the pro- ducers if we could be able to extract related in- formation from this large amount of review and present them in an efficient manner.
There have been different approaches in this field of research such as those purely based on fre- quency  (Rotem, retrieved may 2014) or discover the overall polarity of a document   (Sebastiani et al., 2006).  Some tried to tackle with abstrac- tion/natural language generation   (Portet et al.,
2007); however the abstractive summarize field of research is still quite weak and very open for re- search.  Therefore we propose our SuRe system based on a pilot research by (Labbe´ and Portet,
2012). It not only extracts data from a set of text but also abstractively reforms those data to a tex- tual output i.e.  SuRe decides by itself ”What to say?” and ”How to say it?”.

2   SuRe System

2.1   Architecture
A simple architecture for SuRe system can be vi- sualized as several steps as seen in Figure 1 .



Figure 1: Overall Architecture of the SuRe system


2.2   Opinion Analysis
We consider a product to be composed of different features and these features are described by var- ious opinions mentioned in the free-text reviews. Thus this step intents to extract as much relevant opinions as possible from the source.   First the system extract words referencing features thanks to a pre-defined dictionary/ontology; then opin- ion tokens about these features are extracted using two different methods with slightly different archi- tectures namely Sliding window and Dependency tree.
To account for the many synonyms; these opin- ions were then aggregated using WordNet rela- tions between adjective synsets.
At the end of this step, the flowing data structure is obtained: F eature-N ame  =< Aggregated- Op1, Aggregated-Op2, ..., Aggregated-Opn  >
Where in turn each Aggregated-Op has a gen-
eral number of times that opinion has been men- tioned along with a detail list of information for
each time it was mentioned (from which review, which sentence and what is the polarity).

2.3   Document Planning / Micro Planning

In this research we chose to separate features into positive or negative based on the most frequent opinion that linked to it. SuRe also tries to make a decision if the feature should be described us- ing more than one opinion and in that case what should the conjunction be.  Next step was to de- cide which would be the reference expression of the sentence (e.g that feature was mentioned by how many people) and how should they be refer- enced to.

2.4   Surface Realization

From the planning that has been made in the pre- vious step; a tree structure for each feature is ob- tained.  they are used to create a phrase for the feature by employ Simple NLG (Gatt and Reiter,
2009); then these phrases are grouped up using reference expressions to create sentences.
We chose to make the output as a small hyper- text body code in order to be able to represent it better(with bold text, extra information in form of a pop-up box) as seen in Figure 2.



Figure 2: SuRe output example



3   Result and Evaluation

SuRe project has been implemented in Java and the output has been evaluated in order to give a complete assessment for the project.  We closely assessed different aspects of two opinion analysis approaches(reliability, run-time, output). Later on we carried out a survey to collect people prefer- ences between different type of presentations and linguistic quality of SuRe system base on the us- ing a set of characteristic that were defined for the Document understanding conference (Baten and Dang, 2007) at NIST and presented in Figure 3.

4   Discussion

SuRe system has been proven to be able to handle a large set of reviews to create a short, informative and easy to understand summary in an abstractive manner that is close to the way human process. However there are still problems with SuRe sys- tem that need to be taken in to consideration for future development such as:

• Aggregation can be filtered even more by dif- ferent criteria to create even more concen- trated summary; e.g.  based on temporal in- formation or by age, place, sex, etc.

• A clear word sense disambiguation before aggregation instead of blindly select similar words from WordNet.

• Referencing resolution would also enhance the opinion analysis step since in written re- view, people often use reference as ”they” or
”it” instead of remark again the feature, as well as double negation or even sarcasm.

A Filmmaker Fictionalizes to Get at Difficult Truths



In 1994, when Kimberly Peirce decided to make a short film about the life and tragic death of Brandon Teena, she didn't know that she was beginning a five-year odyssey that would result in the making of her first feature-length movie. Nor did she realize the difficulty of finding the story within the morass of contradictory details. And she had no idea that she was wading into a contentious and continuing debate over artistic license and a filmmaker's obligation to accuracy.
All she knew, she recalls now, was that she couldn't let Teena go. "I fell in love with her," she says.
Peirce said that early drafts of her script hewed closely to the facts, but she couldn't get the story to work dramatically. "It was unwieldy," she said. "I hadn't yet found the underlying emotional truth and the mythic structure."
But the sister of one of the main characters in the movie said she has asked the local theater not to show the film when it reaches Nebraska.
"I'm trying to do everything in my power to stop it," Leslie Tisdale said. "It's a lie of a movie."
Originally named Teena Brandon, Teena had been a sexually confused Nebraska youth who, without role models or support, had tried to make a new identity for herself. She was killed in 1993, at age 21, by men who were incensed when they learned she wasn't a man.
Peirce, then a graduate film student at Columbia University, made two research trips to Nebraska. Tom Nissen and John Lotter were convicted, and eventually Peirce amassed 10,000 pages of trial transcript and performed numerous interviews. Still, much about the story remained submerged.
"A lot of things people said conflicted with each other," she said. "Many times people contradicted themselves. It took a storyteller to figure out what the truth was."
Her movie, "Boys Don't Cry," released last October, has won critical praise and garnered awards for its star, Hilary Swank. But it also has come under attack for the liberties it takes with the facts. It's another recent example of how based-on-fact films--particularly contemporary stories such as "The Insider and "The Hurricane"--can run into problems with those who participated in the real-live events.
Lana Tisdale, Teena's lover, who is portrayed in "Boys Don't Cry" by Chloe Sevigny, has sued the filmmakers and the film's distributor (Fox Searchlight), alleging that because of the film, friends and family members now scorn her as "a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder."
The movie's producers also have been sued by author Aphrodite Jones, whose nonfiction book on the case, "All She Wanted," was to have been made into a movie starring Drew Barrymore. Her lawsuit contends that Fox Searchlight tied up the rights to her book in bad faith. The same studio now is distributing "Boy's Don't Cry."
In her small town, Tisdale had been subjected to abuse even before the movie was made. Many locals reacted with less outrage to the murders than to Teena's deception. Her killers, after all, were local boys, and Teena was from someplace else. She had come into town, tricked the men and romanced the women. She had made fools of them all.
"Once the town of Fall City found out that he was a she, the whole town went ballistic," said Leslie Tisdale, Lana's sister. They're still continually talking about her."
Jones, too, said some of the movie's inventions disturbed her, especially the way it places Lana Tisdale at the scene when the shooting occurred. There was conflicting testimony at the trials as to Lana's whereabouts, and placing her there might suggest that she was an accessory to murder, Jones said.
Many of Peirce's early drafts included the character of Philip Devine, a 22-year-old black man who had been living at the home of Lisa Lambert, where Teena also was living when the shooting took place. Devine was Leslie Tisdale's boyfriend. Teena, Lambert and Devine all were killed, but Peirce eventually cut Devine out of the movie and changed the name of the Lambert character.
"I frown on that," Leslie Tisdale said of Devine's omission. "They're just looking at Brandon Teena, and they're not wanting to think about anybody else. It's like, 'There were two other victims? Who cares.' "
Jones, too, said she is bothered. "Philip Devine was someone who climbed mountains on one leg, literally, in his lifetime, and he was a good soul."
But leaving him in would've required adding Leslie Tisdale as a character to explain who Devine was, said Peirce. "I already had seven main characters," she said. "I didn't have room for Lana's sister."
Peirce maintains that her greater obligation was to Teena. It was her fascination with Teena that caused her to devote five years making the movie, she said. "If I couldn't do honor to Teena, then I couldn't do honor to anybody."
It was revelatory, she says, to watch the story grow stronger as she deleted material and altered facts. "It blew my mind," she said. "You're allowing the myth to take over, which is really what movies are."
Peirce speaks eloquently about the value of myth, of dreams, to illuminate truth, in art as well as life.
"I don't think most people understand the power of dreams," she said. "Dreams take things that are confusing and scary and transform them so that we can understand them." That is what she did with the movie, she said.
"We tell stories so that people can express the things that they are frightened of."


MOmoMNSIEUR HIRE
Patrice Leconte's "Monsieur Hire" is a tragedy about loneliness and erotomania, told about two solitary people who have nothing else in common. It involves a murder, and the opening shot is of a corpse. Monsieur Hire is a scrawny, balding middle-aged tailor who lives by himself. Alice is a beautiful, tender-hearted 22-year-old blonde who lives alone across the courtyard from Hire in the same apartment building.
On the night of the murder, a slight man was seen by witnesses running toward the building. In his investigation among its residents, a police detective learns that nobody likes Hire. Hire is the first to agree. He admits he seems to strike people oddly. As a neighbor from across the hall peeks at him from his doorway, he asks, "Want a photo?" As he walks through his courtyard, white powder is dumped on his impeccable black suit.
