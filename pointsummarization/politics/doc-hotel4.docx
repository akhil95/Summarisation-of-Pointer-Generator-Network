GOP Senate campaign arm abandons Roy Moore following sexual allegations


The chief fundraising committee for Senate Republicans on Friday severed ties with Alabama candidate Roy Moore, following allegations by four women that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them while they were in their teens.
The allegations were first reported by The Washington Post, and Moore has since come under intense pressure to step aside in the Dec. 12 special election.
Moore has denied the claims, calling them politically motivated "garbage."

The chief fundraising vehicle for Republican Senate campaigns on Friday severed its ties to Roy Moore, the party's nominee in Alabama's special election next month.
The break with Moore came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations by four women who said Moore had pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers. At the time, Moore was in his early 30s.
According to new paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is no longer a part of a joint fundraising committee that includes Moore's campaign, the Alabama GOP and the Republican National Committee.
Moore has denied the allegations against him, and his campaign on Thursday said the Post's report, which cited 30 sources, was "garbage," and "the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation."
In Washington, Republican senators responded to the report with shock and dismay, telling reporters that if the claims were true, Moore should exit the race immediately.
Moore's campaign did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment about the NRSC's decision to abandon the race.
As of 2 p.m. ET Friday afternoon, the RNC and the Alabama Republican Party both remained in the joint committee.

This study investigates the role of national culture and balanced organisational culture in organisational performance. Hotel management requires ﬂexibility and customer responsiveness to deal with increas- ingly demanding customers and competitiveness of the market. Studies of the inﬂuence of culture on performance in  hotel management have not yet revealed the speciﬁc impact of  national culture and balanced organisational culture on  organisational performance. We  use the concept of balanced organ- isational culture which posits that polyrational organisations are more responsive to market changes and more innovative. Data were gathered from 96 hotels in London, UK, and were analysed using struc- tural equation modelling. Our  ﬁndings show that the national culture of  hotel employees inﬂuences balanced organisational culture which, in turn, inﬂuences performance. This  study contributes to exist- ing  understanding of factors affecting performance, points towards further research, helps practitioners by  demonstrating the importance of taking national culture into account and indicates the importance of achieving balanced organisational culture.

1.  Introduction

We  examine the roles of national culture and balanced organ- isational culture  in  the  hotel  industry, which are   key   factors inﬂuencing performance. This  study addresses a  problem which managers face  in  any  industry whose customers have globalised standards of expectation, which is to identify what factors have an impact on  organisational performance. For the last three decades organisational scholars have been concerned with culture because they believe organisational culture affects performance (Lee  and Yu,  2004). However, it  is  generally acknowledged that  culture works on a number of different levels and the organisational level is only one (Pizam, 1993). In the context of globalised industries it is relevant for managers, especially those of multi-national cor- porations operating in different regions, to  be  aware of the effect of national culture. This study extends previous studies which have shown that organisational culture affects performance (Prajogo and McDermott, 2011; Lee  and Yu, 2004) and that national culture

affects organisational culture (House et al., 2004; Nazarian et al.,
2014).
The hospitality industry has a number of large players that oper- ate globally setting expectations in the market as a whole for their customers, many of whom travel globally (Teare 1993; Hsieh and Tsai, 2009). Also, the industry has  a large number of internation- ally  mobile personnel who have to  adjust to  different cultures (Li and Tse, 1998; Devine et al., 2007). Additionally, managers in the industry experience different operating conditions in  differ- ent countries giving rise  to  the paradox of how much of a local approach should be  taken versus how much from the industry’s global experience (Jones 1999; Brotherton and Adler,  1999; Jones and McCleary, 2004). For these reasons, we  investigate the effect of national culture on  organisational culture and subsequently on organisational performance in the hotel industry. We argue that the national culture of hotel employees inﬂuences the organisational culture which, in turn, inﬂuences performance and, thus, there is an indirect inﬂuence of national culture on performance.

2.  Research approach

No studies to  date have investigated the relationship between national culture, organisational culture and performance in  the hotel industry (Tajeddini and Trueman, 2008). Previous studies,

that were not industry speciﬁc, have investigated the impact of organisational culture on  performance (Kotter and Heskett, 1992) and the impact of national culture on effectiveness (Nazarian et al.,
2014). Chen  et al. (2012) argue that most studies of hotel manage- ment that investigate national culture in cross-cultural studies have compared national cultures in  relation to  various organisational level issues such as franchising operations or pricing strategy. How- ever, there is a lack  of research on  the impact of national culture on other cultural levels, including organisational culture (Groseschl and Doherty, 2000; Chen  et al., 2012).
The location where the data were gathered for this study is one where there is a large hotel sector and a large number of both inter- nal  and international customers. The possible complication of the respondents not necessarily originating in the location where the data were gathered is overcome by gathering data on national cul- ture at the individual level (Dorfman and Howell, 1988) so that it is the effect of the individuals’ own national culture, whatever that may be,  that is being measured. The  data for  the study were col- lected from managers and employees of 98  hotels in London, UK. Respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire with items on national culture, the current state of their organisations’ cultures and aspects of their organisations’ performance related to organisa- tional effectiveness, learning and growth and customer orientation.


3.  Theoretical background

Having identiﬁed the problem, the next task was to  identify suitable approaches for national culture, organisational culture and performance that would aid its investigation. The criterion for mak- ing  the choice was the utility of the approach for  answering the research question.
In the context of this study, it is important not to be seduced by the dictionary deﬁnition of the words that are  used to describe the constructs. For example, when Hofstede (1980) and Schein (2010) use  the word “culture” they do  not mean the same thing, though there may be some overlap in their meanings. It is unnecessary to attempt formal deﬁnitions of these terms; instead, it is safe  to say that they are  deﬁned by their actual use.  Thus  for  example, what Hofstede means by  culture is ultimately deﬁned by  the meaning attached by respondents to the questions in his survey instruments and the same goes for the other constructs that we use; for a discus- sion of this problem in the case of performance see Lebas and Euske (2007). Therefore, we  shall not attempt deﬁnitions but use  well- known constructs that are  familiar to academics and practitioners alike.


3.1.  National culture

Though culture scholars share no  precise agreement on  what is meant by  the term “culture” there is a general agreement that culture  works at  different  levels (Pizam, 1993). The   generally acknowledged levels are  national, organisational, industry, profes- sional (occupational) and individual (Chen et al., 2012). Hofstede believes that the national level is the most fundamental and is at the heart of the primary socialisation process in  early childhood (Hofstede et al., 2010) giving people their values and beliefs. This view of the relationship between the national and the other lev- els  of culture is a tacit assumption for  most culture scholars. This study, therefore, takes national culture to  be  the context for  the other constructs.
Thus,  it is to be expected that national culture has  a noticeable effect on the behaviour of employees and a number of studies con- ﬁrm this. Pizam (1993) shows that national culture has  a greater effect than industrial culture on  the behaviour of hotel managers. A similar conclusion was drawn by  Merritt (2000) in  a study of

airline pilots. Testa (2007) showed that national cultural diversity has  an impact on the relationship between managers and subordi- nates in the hospitality industry. However, Gerhart and Fang (2005) concluded that there is a case for  a more nuanced view. In their meta-analytical study of the relationship between national culture and management practices they concluded that the strength of the effect of national culture varied with other factors, notably organi- sational culture.
There are  a  number of  versions of  the national culture con- struct that could be used for research (Chen et al., 2012). The best known are Hofstede’s with up to six dimensions and the GLOBE sur- vey  with nine dimensions. Because a large number of dimensions would make the study too  complex and because it is an  approach that is thoroughly tested and widely understood, it  was decided to  use   Hofstede’s original four   dimensions of  national culture: power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance and mas- culinity/femininity. Hofstede’s approach has  been criticised (Jones,
2007; McCoy  et al.,  2005; McSweney, 2002), however, it  is  still recognised as  useful and has  been recently applied in  studies of the hospitality industry (Reisinger and Crotts, 2010). Most of the criticisms of Hofstede’s study have been aimed at its methodology which is not employed in this research (McSweney, 2002; McCoy et al., 2005). The remainder of the criticisms have been directed at the interdependent nature of the dimensions which is not signiﬁ- cant for this study (Dorfman and Howell, 1988; Ali et al., 2008).

3.2.  Organisational culture

Since   the evolution of  the concept of  organisational culture in  the mid-twentieth century, this concept has  been deﬁned in many ways; however, what all these deﬁnitions have in common is that organisational culture consists of values, beliefs and assump- tions which are shared or communicated among members (Schein,
2010), guide behaviour and facilitate shared meaning (Alvesson,
2013; Denison, 1996).
Scholars have investigated the impact of organisational culture on performance. Wilson and Bates (2003) argue that a strong organ- isational culture plays the roles of reliable compass and powerful lever that can guide organisational members’ behaviour. According to  Barney (1991) organisational culture is the main resource that organisations have to  maintain their competitive advantage and many studies have investigated the impact of organisational cul- ture on  organisational performance (Sinclair and Sinclair, 2009). The existing literature implies that there is a relationship between organisational culture and organisational performance (Kemp and Dwyer, 2001). Although there are  different conceptualisations  of organisational culture, this study adopts the competing values framework (CVF) because it may be used to reveal the relationship between organisational culture and organisational performance or effectiveness (Gregory et al., 2009; Cameron and Quinn, 2011).
CVF was developed to  measure  organisational effectiveness (Quinn and  Rohrbaugh, 1983);  however,  later  CVF  became a multi-purpose instrument  (Quinn and Spreitzer, 1991; Cameron and Freeman, 1991) which enables researchers to  measure both organisational culture and organisational effectiveness (Gregory et al.,  2009).  Two   axes are   employed to   distinguish between four  main organisational cultures; these axes, or  dimensions, are internal/external and stability/ﬂexibility. The internal/external axis indicates how much organisations concentrate on  internal  fac- tors such as employee satisfaction or external factors such as the ability to  function well in a competitive environment (Quinn and Rohrbaugh, 1983). On the other hand, the stability/ﬂexibility axis indicates how much organisations are  concerned with consistent patterns of behaviour or allowing employees to use  their initiative (Quinn and Rohrbaugh, 1983). These two axes create a quadrant representing four distinct organisational culture types: clan, adhoc-

racy,  market and hierarchy (Cameron and Quinn, 2011). Cameron and Quinn (2011) argue that all organisations always have all these four  cultures, though in different proportions, and the same organ- isation can   have different proportions at different times. Thus, ﬁnding the most appropriate balance between the four   culture types is essential for optimal organisational management.
According to  CVF, organisational culture is  a  combination  of characteristics such as  team working; innovation and risk   tak- ing (Tajeddini and Trueman, 2008; Tajeddini and Trueman, 2012); orientation to  market responsiveness and customer satisfaction (Deshpande et al., 1993) or  having a deﬁnite structure of author- ity  with control over work-ﬂows, similar to Weber’s ideal-type of bureaucracy (Cameron and Quinn, 2011).
CVF is not merely a classiﬁcation of organisational cultures but also  gives insight into how the culture types interact and com- bine with each other. Quinn (1988) recommends that organisations that have balanced cultures with a  strong presence of  all  four organisational culture types have an advantage in a rapidly chang- ing  environment. A balanced culture provides the organisation with a broad spread of viewpoints and values which enables it to respond to  different conditions and changing customer require- ments (Gregory et al.,  2009). A recent study by  Hartnell et al. (2011) indicates that CVF culture types which are diagonally oppo- site each other in  the quadrant do  not compete but co-exist and work together (p.687). Therefore, it is important for organisations to have a culture that can  accommodate all four  culture types. He further argues that successful organisations are ones that can man- age these contradictory culture types and create a combined culture that meets their needs.
For these reasons, in this study the organisational culture con- struct consists of  clustering the four  CVF organisational culture types and seeing it  in  terms of  balanced organisational culture. The concept of balanced organisational culture assumes that organ- isations are   more responsive to  their environments, especially to  unexpected changes, if  they are   able to  operate in  different combinations of  parts of  the quadrant as  required by  changing circumstances (Quinn 1988; Gregory et al., 2009).

3.3.  Organisational performance

Organisational performance is  a  signiﬁcant concern for  man- agers because it allows them to  assess the success of elements of the organisational strategy in  objective terms. Although scholars tend to use  the terms effectiveness and performance interchange- ably  (eg.  Pfeffer and Sutton, 1999; Werther et al.,  1995; Sellani,
1994), effectiveness is often used to  represent organisational potentials whereas performance measures outcomes. According to  Henri (2004) organisational effectiveness and organisational performance have evolved in  parallel from the same needs but effectiveness examines the resources and processes from an inter- nal  standpoint  and performance includes perspectives which a range of stakeholders might ﬁnd of interest to them.
Performance has  come to signify a set  of measures of organisa- tional activity that are  of interest to a range of stakeholders. In this study it is connected to the use  of the term by Kaplan and Norton whose construct was developed as  a strategic tool for  measuring the success of  managerial strategies (Kaplan and Norton, 1996). Prior to the 1990s performance was usually conceived of as purely concerned with accountancy measures (Otely, 2007) but with the growing popularity of stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984) a differ- ent kind of measure was required. Thus, Kaplan and Norton’s model of performance includes different perspectives on the organisation and speciﬁcally includes the customers’ perspective.
Kaplan and Norton (1992) devised and promoted the balanced scorecard as a means for managers to focus on what they need to do to achieve strategic objectives. It is a means of taking a snapshot of

indicators of progress. The results of the balanced scorecard have to  be  interpreted by  decision makers in  a particular context and according to  their perception of causal relationships (Kaplan and Norton, 1996; Lebas  and Euske, 2007).
A number of objections have been raised to the balanced score- card approach. A common objection is that it fails  to  address the needs of  employees and suppliers (Neely et al.,  2007). Norreklit (2000) points out  that  the  four   different  perspectives  of  the balanced scorecard are assumed to have a mutually causal relation- ship. It is assumed that: the measures of organisational learning and growth drive the measures of  internal business processes which drive the measures of the customer perspective which, in turn, drive the ﬁnancial measures (Kaplan and Norton, 1996; p.31; Norreklit, 2000). However, these relationships do  not necessarily hold. Despite these objections the balanced scorecard continues to be a useful broad measure of performance (Antonsen, 2014; Hoque,
2014).
In  this study a  simpliﬁed version of  the balanced scorecard approach is used which leaves out measures of ﬁnancial perfor- mance. This  aspect was not included because of the difﬁculty in collecting this data from employees who would not necessarily have access to  it. However, our  approach includes organisational members’ perceptions of: customers’ perception, internal business processes (effectiveness) and learning and growth.


4.  Conceptual framework and research hypotheses

The  conceptual framework shown in  Fig.  1  shows the  link between well-established constructs of  Hofstede’s national cul- ture (individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity) (1980) as measured by Dorfman and Howell (1988), organisational culture as measured by Cameron and Quinn (2011) and  organisational  performance  as   measured  by   Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard (1996).
The participants in this study work in an industry which forms an international network and personnel are  typically mobile often moving from country to  country to  broaden their experience. For this reason, it  was decided to  collect data about national culture at the individual level since it  would not matter whether or  not the individual respondent had been formed by the same national culture as another respondent in the same location (Dorfman and Howell, 1988).
It  is  assumed that national culture is  the context in  which organisational culture is  created and that organisational culture is  the context in  which organisational performance is  created. Thus,  national culture must have an  effect on  organisational per- formance and organisational culture mediates the relationship between  national culture and organisational performance. The relationships between the three constructs are  shown in Fig. 1.


4.1.  National culture dimensions and  organisational culture

Studies of  organisational culture in  hotel management have investigated its  effect on  different aspects of the industry. Hemmington and King (2000) looked at issues such as how to match organisational culture with operational proximity, or how adopt- ing a mix of service and project management culture could improve hotel efﬁciency (Sinclair and Sinclair, 2009). Brownell and Jameson (1996) found that organisational culture affects employees’ under- standing of  the service concept. Organisational culture can  be  a major driver for hotel management strategy formation which ulti- mately has  an  impact on  organisational performance (Kemp and Dwyer, 2001).
Organisation scholars have investigated how national culture impacts different aspects of organisations. Hofstede et al. (2010)



Fig.  1.  The relationship between the three constructs.

argues that national culture is stable and mainly concerned with basic values whereas organisational culture is related to practices that are  shared by  members and therefore it  is easier to  change and manage them. Kilduff (1993) demonstrates that members of an organisation who have a different nationality to  the organisation modify the existing cultural patterns to  create a speciﬁc cultural routine that aligns with their own culture. This clearly indicates that people with cultural differences would understand and, therefore, react to the same organisational problem in different ways accord- ing  to  their interpretation of it. This  difference sometimes means that they ignore, modify, or even bend, some rules and procedures (Jermier et al., 1991) which can sometimes create conﬂict and a neg- ative impact if they are  evaluated according to  the organisation’s original cultural values (Gregory, 1983). In the study of Iranian pri- vate sector organisations Nazarian et al. (2014) found that there was a signiﬁcant relationship between national culture dimensions and market culture in medium sized organisations whereas in large sized organisations national culture dimensions have a relationship with hierarchy culture. According to Chen  et al. (2012), due to dif- ferences in national cultures, and with the inﬂuence of globalisation on people’s travel habits, preferences and working behaviour, it is essential that cultural studies moves towards a  global approach and investigates the impact of national culture on  organisational cultures.
Therefore, based on what has  been discussed these hypotheses are  proposed:

H1.    There is a relationship between the individualistic dimension of national culture and balanced organisational culture

H2.    There is a relationship between power distance and balanced organisational culture

H3.     There is a relationship between uncertainly avoidance and balanced organisational culture

H4.     There is  a  relationship between masculinity and balanced organisational culture

4.2.  Organisational culture and  performance in hotel management

A number of studies have used different versions of organisa- tional culture and organisational performance to  investigate the relationship between the two. The studies by Gordon and DiTomaso (1992) and Denison and Mishra (1995) found that having a strong culture is  positively associated with short-term ﬁnancial perfor- mance. On the other hand, Kotter and Heskett (1992) found that having an “adaptive values” culture can  signiﬁcantly improve per- formance in the long-run compared to the short-term. Lee and Yu (2004) investigated the relationships between the organisational culture types of Singaporean organisations and found that the cul- tural strength of organisations was often related to organisational performance. They also found that those cultural elements that dis- tinguish organisations from each other have a positive impact on

organisational performance. Furthermore, in  a  study of  96  busi- nesses in the Swiss hotel industry, Tajeddini and Trueman (2012), found that the national cultural dimensions adopted for that study (power distance, long-term orientation and individualism) were positively associated with innovation and customer orientation as well as both innovation and customer orientation having positive association with organisational performance. They also found that, similar to  Chen’s  (2011) studies of the Taiwanese hotel industry, having the customer as the main focus helps to achieve long-term proﬁtability. Their results are  aligned with previous studies that view customer orientation as part of overall organisational culture and argue that in  order to  achieve long-term organisational per- formance there is  a  need for  establishing market culture which requires recruiting a  well-qualiﬁed and experienced workforce (Deshpande et al., 1993).
Additionally, a number of studies have used CVF to investigate the relationship between organisational culture and performance. Deshpande et  al.  (1993) studied  the  impact of  organisational culture, innovation and customer orientation on  organisational performance in  50  Japanese ﬁrms, using organisational culture types derived from CVF, and found that  market culture has   a major impact on  organisational performance creating the best results because of  its  emphasis on  competitive advantage and market  superiority, whereas hierarchy culture contributes to unsatisfactory organisational performance because it emphasises bureaucracy. Furthermore, they  argue that  because adhocracy emphasises innovation and risk  taking it is normally expected to provide better organisational performance compared with clan cul- ture. In a recent study on the relationship between organisational culture and organisational performance, Prajogo and McDermott (2011) examined a  sample of  194  middle and senior managers of Australian ﬁrms and found that among all  four  cultural types only adhocracy (developmental) culture was a strong predicator of performance.
The studies to date indicate that none of the organisational cul- ture types alone is likely to provide organisations with all the values and approaches that they need to  respond to  their dynamic envi- ronment and achieve high performance. Therefore, this hypothesis is proposed:

H5.    Balanced organisational culture is positively associated with organisational performance in hotel management.


5.  Methods

A questionnaire was designed containing 61  items. There is an  initial section containing 5 items concerning the demographic and background data of  the respondent. The  next section con- tains 22  items concerned with national culture and these were taken directly from Dorfman and Howell’s (1988) instrument. The following section contains 24 items concerned with balanced organisational culture which is a modiﬁed version of Cameron and Quinn’s (2011) instrument. The ﬁnal section contains 10 items con-

cerned with organisational performance and these were adopted from Kaplan and Norton’s (1996) concept of the balanced scorecard.

5.1.  Data collection

The formulated hypotheses were examined via a sample of hotel employees and managers from London, UK. The  study was con- ducted using convenience sampling (McDaniel and Gates, 2006). This  data was collected between August 2015 and January 2016.
980  questionnaires were sent to  employee and manager partici- pants from which 236  usable questionnaires were returned and analysed.
The  survey consisted of  questions referring to  managers and employees’ perceptions of the impact of the national culture and organisation culture on organisational performance. The data were collected by  email and the face-to-face method, and, to  increase the  sample size   and to   make sure that  the  sample included the most knowledgeable informants, non-probability ‘snowballing’ was used as a distribution method by asking initial informants to suggest others who could offer  further insights (Goodman, 1961).
A summary of  the demographic characteristics are  shown in Table  1. The majority of the respondents were female (69.1%), the largest age  group was between 25 and 34 (31.4%) and a high pro- portion were professionals (48%). 73% of the data were collected from hotels with more than 250  employees.

5.2.  Measurement

Measurement  for   the  constructs of  interest  was based on established scales from previous research, proven to  be  statisti- cally  sound (Churchill, 1999; Hair  et al., 2006). The  questionnaire contains four   sections, 1)  demographics, 2)  national culture, 3) organisational culture, and 4) organisational performance.
National culture was measured through four   constructs:  (i) power distance, (ii)  individualism/collectivism, (iii)  uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity/femininity using Dorfman and Howell’s (1988) scale. The balanced organisational culture scale was adopted from CVF (Cameron and Quinn, 2011; Quinn and Spreitzer, 1991) which was tested by four  constructs (clan culture, adhocracy cul- ture, market culture, hierarchy culture). Kalliath et al. (1999) tested this instrument to check whether there is any social desirability bias


adapted from Kaplan and Norton’s (1996) balanced scorecard. In this study the authors decided to ignore the ﬁnancial performance aspect for  three reasons 1)  it  was not possible to  get  any  hard ﬁnancial data, 2)  the respondents may not have access to  this information and (3)  the authors believe that a  question regard- ing ﬁnancial performance would not provide valuable information on the reality of the ﬁnancial status of the company. Since  Kaplan and Norton see the ﬁnancial measures of the balanced scorecard as being at the end of the causal chain where one of the four  perspec- tives drives the next (Kaplan and Norton, 1996), it was assumed that a coherent and accurate representation could be  gained without this information.
Therefore, the 10  questions that measured the organisational performance were based on  the three constructs of  Kaplan and Norton (1996): 1) customer orientation, 2) organisational effective- ness and 3) learning and growth. Organisational performance was measured using a ﬁve-point Likert rating scale ranging from (1) “entirely unfulﬁlled” to  (5)  “entirely fulﬁlled”. Table  2 shows the domain of the construct in extant literature.

5.3.  Construct validity

The  preliminary measures were subjected to  a series of factor and reliability analyses as  preliminary tests of their performance within the entire sample. The  Anderson and Gerbing (1988) two- stage procedure was followed. First,  exploratory factor analyses were run for  each set   of  constructs which attained the theo- retically expected factor solutions. At this stage, the preliminary measures were subjected to  a series of factor and reliability anal- yses as preliminary examinations of their performance within the entire sample. Table 3 provides descriptive information for the con- structs of interest. We examined composite reliability or construct reliability, which measures the internal consistency of  the indi- cators, showing the extent to  which they indicate the common latent construct. Composite reliability of  all  measures exceeded
0.94  and suggested a satisfactory level of reliability (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair  et al., 2006). The  scales were well above the com- monly accepted requirements for  reliability tests (0.707 through
806 > 0.70) (Hair et al., 2006 Nunnally, 1978). Therefore, composite reliability (rho) can  be the better coefﬁcient because it is based on a congeneric assumption.
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to analyse inter- relationships between large numbers of variables, and to  deﬁne such variables in terms of their common underlying factors (Hair et al., 2006). Initially, 56  items relating to  the research constructs were examined using EFA to contribute to nine theoretically estab- lished constructs. Cronbach’s alpha measures the consistency of each component with its  relevant items (Nunnally, 1978) and the results for  each factor (0.824 through 0.944) conﬁrmed that the items in each factor were internally consistent (Nunnally, 1978).
Tabachnick and Fidell  (2007) recommend that the use  of EFA to determine the factor structure of measures, examine internal reli- ability and discover underlying structures in relatively large sets of variables. EFA was run separately for the two sets of questionnaires. EFA analysis determines the dimensionality of a set  of variables to  speciﬁcally test whether one factor can  account for the bulk of the common variance in a set  (Tabachnick and Fidell  2007). KMO’s measure of sampling adequacy (0.780 > 0.6) suggests that the rela- tionship between items is statistically signiﬁcant and is suitable for

PDI1                             It is important to have job requirements and instructions spelled out in detail so that employees always know what they are expected to do.
PDI2                            Managers expect employees to closely follow instructions and procedures.
PDI3                            Rules and regulations are important because they inform employees what the organisation expects of them.
PDI4	Standard operating procedures are helpful to employees on the job. PDI5	Instructions for  operations are important for  employees on the job. PDI6	Group welfare is more important than individual rewards. Individualism/Collectivism (IDV)
IDV1                                    Group success is more important than individual success.
IDV2                                    Being accepted by  the members of your workgroup is very important.
IDV3                                    Employees should only pursue their goals after considering the welfare of the group.
IDV4                                    Managers should encourage group loyalty even if individual goals suffer.
IDV5                                    Individuals may be expected to give up their goals in order to beneﬁt group success.
Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)
UAI 1                           Managers should make most decisions without consulting subordinates.
UAI 2                          It is frequently necessary for  a manager to use authority and power when dealing with subordinates.
UAI 3                           Managers should seldom ask for  the opinions of employees.
UAI 4                           Managers should avoid off-the-job social contacts with employees. UAI 5                           Employees should not disagree with management decisions. Masculinity/Femininity (MAS)
MAS1                         Managers should not delegate important tasks to employees.
MAS2                         Meetings are usually run more effectively when they are chaired by  a man.
MAS3                              It is more important for  men to have a professional career than it is for  women to have a professional career.
MAS4                          Men usually solve problems with logical analysis; women usually solve problems with intuition. MAS5                          Solving organisational problems usually requires an active forcible approach which is typical of men. MAS6                              It is preferable to have a man in a high level position rather than a woman.

EFA to provide a parsimonious set of factors (Tabachnick and Fidell,
2007). Following Hair  et al.’s (2006) recommendations, Bartlett’s test of Sphericity indicates that the correlation among the mea- surement items is higher than 0.3 and are  suitable for EFA. Table  5 reveals the rotated component matrix of the scale for  which the results show that the items loaded on nine factors (0.706 through
0.875) satisﬁed the minimum criteria for factor loadings (Hair et al.,

The conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to allow a stricter assessment of construct uni-dimensionality; the examina- tion of each subset of items was internally consistent and validated the constructs on the basis of the measurement models (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). In a series of analyses, the correlation between each pair of latent variables was constrained to 1. In every case,  the

constraint signiﬁcantly worsened the model ﬁt (Dx 2. 10;  df 1–4  1; p 1–4 0:01) (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). In addition, the variance extracted for  each construct was compared to  the square of each off-diagonal value within the Phi-matrix for that construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). In all  cases, the variance extracted exceeded the Phi  estimates, suggesting that each set  of items represents a distinct underlying concept. This research applied Pearson’s corre- lations matrix at the 0.01  signiﬁcance level (2-tailed) to determine the linearity and multi-collinearity of the constructs; it found that the majority of the independent variables considerably positively correlated to the dependent variables (Table 4) and the majority of variables were linear with each other.
Following that step, the structural model ﬁt through goodness- of-ﬁt indices was tested  by  application of  analysis of  moment structure using AMOS 16.0 for Windows software to run the model to  test the hypotheses by  using all  available observations.  The model ﬁt  was evaluated for  overall ﬁtness by  referring to  the ﬁt indices (Byrne, 2001; Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007; Hair et al., 2006). Therefore, the CFI and RMSEA provide sufﬁcient unique informa- tion to  evaluate a model (Hair et al., 2006). Based on  the criteria, Garver and Mentzer (1999) recommend that the comparative ﬁt index (CFI)  (0.900 > 0.90) indicates  good ﬁt  and the root mean squared approximation of error (RMSEA) 0.061 < 0.08  is an  incre- mental index that evaluates the ﬁt of a model with the null baseline model (Hair et al., 2006). CFI is considered as an improved version of the NFI index (Hair et al., 2006; Tabachnick and Fidell,  2007). The  Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), also  known as  the non-normed ﬁt
index (NNFI), compares the   2  value of the model with that of the
independent model and takes degrees of freedom for  the model into consideration (Byrne, 2001; Hair  et al., 2006; Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007). So, the measurement model of these three factors was nomologically valid (Steenkamp and van Trijp, 1991). Additionally, the incremental ﬁt  index (IFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) were
0.901 and 0.901 respectively, greater than the suggested thresh- old of 0.90  (Hair et al., 2006), and each criteria of ﬁt thus indicated that the proposed measurement model’s ﬁt  was acceptable Since these measures mean it is difﬁcult to  provide a favourable ﬁt  for the model, these results can  only be additional information.



5.4.  Hypothesis testing

Hypotheses 1–4  are  concerned with the relationships between the four  national culture dimensions and balanced organisational culture. In  summary, the  correlation coefﬁcients, presented  in Table  4, suggest that the national culture dimensions, apart from power distance, show positive correlation with organisational cul- ture; however, the regression path analysis shows that there is a  relationship between power distance and balanced organisa- tional culture but it  shows no  relationship between masculinity and organisational culture.
Hypothesis 1 is concerned with the relationship between power distance and balanced organisational culture. According to  the standardised parameter estimates, which are  shown in  Table  5, the regression path between power distance and organisation cul-

ture shows a signiﬁcant relationship between these two variables
(ˇ = 0.362, t = 3.732). So, this hypothesis is fully  supported.
Hypothesis  2   is   concerned with  the  relationship between individualism/collectivism and  balanced organisational culture. According  to   Table   5,  the  regression path  between  individu- alism/collectivism and organisation culture shows a  signiﬁcant relationship between these two variables (ˇ = 0.511, t = 2.700). So, this hypothesis is fully  supported.
Hypothesis 3 is concerned with the relationship between uncer- tainty avoidance and balanced organisational culture. According to Table  5, the regression path between uncertainty avoidance and organisation culture shows a signiﬁcant relationship between these two variables (ˇ = 0.778, t = 5.936). So, this hypothesis is fully  sup- ported.
Hypothesis 4 is concerned with the relationship between mas- culinity/femininity and balanced organisational culture. According to  Table   5,  the regression path between masculinity/femininity and organisation culture shows no signiﬁcant relationship between these  two variables (ˇ = 0–0.122, t = −1.638, p = 0.101). So,  this hypothesis is rejected.
Hypothesis 5 is concerned with the relationship between bal- anced organisational culture and performance. Our  ﬁndings show that  balanced organisational culture positively correlates with organisational performance, which is consistent with the extant lit- erature. The regression path analysis in Table 5 shows that the effect of organisation culture on organisation performance is statistically signiﬁcant (ˇ = 0.140, t = 2.773) and, therefore, this hypothesis is fully  supported (Fig. 2).


6.  Discussion and implication

The  hospitality industry has  become globalised and it is expe- riencing the same challenges as  other globalised industries. For its  managers not least among these challenges is  to  understand the impact of national culture and organisational culture on  the performance of  the organisation. Since  the UK is  one the major tourist destinations of the world, the UK hotel industry can  pro- vide a rich understanding of this phenomenon. This study examines these relationships in the UK context and reveals some expected and some unexpected results.
The  aim  of this research is to  investigate the impact of Hofst- ede’s  four  national culture dimensions on balanced organisational culture and the impact of balanced organisational culture on  per- formance in the hotel industry in the UK. Our ﬁndings indicate that three of the four dimensions of national culture that were tested do have an effect on balanced organisational culture, but masculinity does not. This generally indicates the importance of the impact of national culture on organisational culture and, in turn on, organisa- tional performance. This result was expected from previous studies (Hofstede, 2001). However, according to  Hofstede the UK has  a national culture which has  a moderately high score on masculinity leading to the expectation that British people tend to be competi- tive and driven by achievement (Hofstede et al., 2010). So the lack of a relationship between masculinity and organisation culture in the UK hotel industry is unexpected. There is no obvious explanation for

this ﬁnding and it requires further research to gain understanding of it.
According to  previous studies (Tajeddini and Trueman, 2012; Deshpandé and Webster, 1989), the  hotel industry believes in putting  customers’ needs and wants  ﬁrst in  order to   achieve high organisational performance and we  would expect this to  be true of  the UK as  well. Because the hotel industry is  very com- petitive, companies are   successful when they are   able to  meet their customers’ needs based on an understanding of those needs. However, our  ﬁndings suggest that hotel managers also  need to consider employee’s values and beliefs and their contribution to higher performance. Therefore, the importance of employees on the front line  that are  dealing with customers becomes evident (Chen, 2011). In a study of Swiss hotel management, Tajeddini and Trueman (2012) found that there is a strong relationship between the national culture dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, individ- ualism, short-term/long-term orientation) and the organisational culture elements of innovativeness and market orientation and per- formance. Therefore, involving employees in  decision making by empowering them, which is consistent with UK national culture characterized by  high individualism, low   uncertainly avoidance and low  power distance, could be the major factor for successfully enhancing organisational performance in this context.
However, in  the correlation analysis it  is  signiﬁcant that the results contradict the regression analysis in  that power distance shows no  correlation with organisational culture. This  result is not consistent with expectations for  the UK which is  a  country that scores low  on  power distance (Hofstede, 1980). It could be explained, at the organisational level, if there is a high degree of power distance internally among managers and employees there may be  a failure to  create a balanced organisational culture. Such a situation would have a negative impact on  organisational per- formance (Yilmaz et al., 2005) because, in order to achieve higher performance, organisations need both informal and formal com- munication, whereas organisations with a high degree of power distance normally suffer from a lack  of informal communication. The results of our  study are  consistent with the results of a study by Ayoun and Moreo (2008) of the impact of power distance on the business strategy development of top hotel organisations in  four countries (Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey and USA) which found that, despite the expectation that countries with low  scores on  power distance would have a participative approach to  management, it found the reverse: that countries with high power distance have a more participative approach. These contradictory ﬁndings need further investigation to  understand the inconsistency and to  gain deeper insight into the nature of power distance and other dimen- sions of national culture in the UK context, perhaps with a larger sample and with data from other industries.
There are   a  number of  particular pressures in  this industry that create the need for  a  ﬂexible organisational culture: (1)  as well as customers from different backgrounds the employees also come from different backgrounds; (2)  they have to  be  responsive to  external stakeholders, including their customers, and internal

stakeholders, and (3)  they also   have to  be  responsive to  rapid changes in  the market place (Giorgi et al.,  2015; Laesser et al.,
2014). Therefore, for organisations to succeed in the hotel industry they need a balanced organisational culture which is adaptable and responsive to a changing environment (Gregory et al., 2009). These ﬁndings conﬁrm previous studies of organisational culture and per- formance in different countries, such as Switzerland, that indicate the impact of  market and customer orientation, as  elements  of organisational culture, on organisational performance (Kessapidou and Varsakelis, 2002; Tajeddini and Trueman, 2012).
The UK national culture, according to Hofstede’s proﬁle (1980), might be expected to produce a conducive context for good organ- isational performance: it  scores low   on  power distance, which empowers employees and encourages involvement giving them a feeling of belonging; it scores high on individualism, which encour- ages individual responsibility and innovation; it  also  scores high on  masculinity/femininity, which indicates a  high level of  com- mitment to  work and drive for  success and, it  scores low   on uncertainty avoidance, indicating that  employees will   be  more likely to  try  new ideas rather than insisting on  traditional pro- cedures thus potentially making the organisation more market orientated (Hofstede et al., 2010). So, this combination of national culture scores could be  expected to  produce a balanced organisa- tional culture which is competitive and innovative (Gregory et al.,
2009; Cameron and Quinn, 2011) and contribute to organisational performance (Tajeddini and Trueman, 2012).
Our  ﬁndings conﬁrm that there is a relationship between bal- anced organisational culture and performance. This  is consistent with Gregory et al.  (2009) which suggests that an  organisation requires not only a strong organisational culture but also  one that has  a balance of all  four  culture types which allows ﬂexibility in thinking. In the hotel industry being responsive to a changing envi- ronment requires managers to be ﬂexible, innovative and customer orientated (Deshpande et al., 1993; Yilmaz et al., 2005). Thus,  our ﬁndings indicate that if hospitality managers implement a balanced organisational culture which creates a ﬂexible environment that may be readily modiﬁed to meet changing customer needs, a sus- tainable competitive advantage may be  achieved which, in  turn, enhances organisational performance (Ottenbacher, 2007; Orﬁla- Sintes and Mattssona, 2009).
It is also  a factor in the hotel industry that it is dealing with a globalised market for customers and employees so hotel managers must be aware of the effects of national culture on their organisa- tions. This study shows that national culture impacts the balanced organisational culture which, in turn, impacts performance. Thus, hotel managers must take this factor into account when trying to manage the organisational culture.
Thus,  this research adds to  existing knowledge in  two ways, ﬁrstly, by demonstrating the effect of national culture on balanced organisational culture and, secondly, by demonstrating the effect of balanced organisational culture on performance in the hotel indus- try. Although, the effect of balanced organisational culture on other organisational factors has  been investigated by  Quinn (1988), no

previous investigation has  been undertaken of the factors affecting balanced organisational culture. Our  study of the hotel industry is consistent with the results of Gregory et al. (2009) which examined the relationship between organisational culture and performance in general and introduces balanced organisational culture as a sig- niﬁcant factor into the discussion of this relationship.


7.  Limitations and further study

This study was conducted using 96 hotels and 236  respondents. Reliability of the results would be improved by having a larger sam- ple  size.  Additionally, with a wider range of hotels included in the survey comparisons could be  made between results from differ- ent categories of hotel, for  example, size  or chain compared with independents.
This study shows that there is a relationship between the three constructs examined but the data was only gathered in one loca- tion. To further study these relationships other locations, nationally and internationally, should be  included and comparisons made between the data from different locations. Comparisons between data gathered in different countries potentially would be informa- tive.
Our  study shows an  unexpected lack  of  correlation between the power distance dimension of  national culture and balanced organisational culture. Ayoun and Moreo (2008) also  found that the relationship between power distance and business strategy was unexpected which indicates that this dimension is problematic in some way and further research should be carried out to investigate it.
Our  study also  shows a surprising lack  of effect of masculin- ity on balanced organisational culture. According to Hofstede et al. (2010), a moderate to  high level of masculinity makes for  a ten- dency to  competitiveness which would be  expected to  enhance performance. Further study should be undertaken in different loca- tions to discover if this result is peculiar to the location of our study and to gain deeper insight into this relationship.
Additional further study should include research on  the direct impact of  national culture on  organisational  performance.  This knowledge would be of immediate beneﬁt to hotel managers.
Another area that was beyond the scope of this study is a com- parison between national culture and performance for  managers and employees. It is possible that the two groups may show differ- ent results.
