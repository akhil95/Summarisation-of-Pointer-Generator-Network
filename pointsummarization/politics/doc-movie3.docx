You might recall that Deadpool included a funny montage featuring the hero (Ryan Reynolds) and girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) "celebrating" the holidays. With the US staple Thanksgiving coming up, the first official poster for Deadpool 2 has arrived, celebrating families getting together, as shared via Reynolds' twitter feed.

Thanksgiving in our house is a glorious, non-stop car accident set to the music of cocaine.

While we haven't had many details about the movie's story – beyond the addition of Josh Brolin's Cable and Zazie Beetz' Domino – the poster confirms the return of TJ Miller as Weasel along with some of the other Deadpool cast. We're honestly not sure what a Deadpool thanksgiving would actually look like, but probably a bit bloodier than this.
In related Wade Wilson news, the latest clever promotional twist for the character and his sequel is having him show up in the pages (and cover) of Good Housekeeping. Not the most natural combination you might imagine, but it certainly seems to be bringing the mirth, with actual recipes (albeit with silly Deadpool names such as D's Spiced Nuts) and even a letter from Wade himself.

"Deadpool’s persistence to be in Good Housekeeping was impressive – initially we had no idea who he was, let alone that he was a fan of the magazine," says Jane Francisco, Editor in Chief, Good Housekeeping. "But after repeated attempts to ignore his… passion… we came to a compromise. He could appear in one issue, if he promised to stop leaving care packages at our editors’ homes and agreed to maintain a 50-foot distance from the Good Housekeepingoffices and our staff."
"After years of weekly emails and countless carrier pigeons, Good Housekeeping finally returned my calls," says Deadpool. "And while it’s a dream come true, apparently we have vastly different opinions on the definition of a 'holiday spread'…"
As for the movie itself, the madness lands on 1 June next year.

Seth Rogen's TVAdaptation Of GarthEnnis' The Boys IsFinally MovingForward
It would appear that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are the people to go to if you want to actually put an adaptation of a Garth Ennis comic on to screens. Following their success with Preacher, their collaboration with Supernatural creator Eric Kripke to bring The Boys is springing to life at Amazon.
The Boys, which Ennis created alongside Darick Robertson, is set in a world where superheroes are a widely-mistrusted annoyance – "absolute scum" in Ennis' own words – leading to the creation of the only marginally preferable anti-cape vigilante group of the title. Membership includes murderous black-ops marine Billie Butcher; Gallic madman The Frenchman; super-strong psychopath mute The Female (Of The Species); and the incongruously decent – but psychologically scarred – Wee Hughie.
Adam McKay was in discussions to make a film of the comic for Sony back in 2010, but that didn't go very far, possibly because of the violent, graphic content and the fact that Deadpool hadn't yet cracked the door open again for harder-edged comic book adaptations. Rogen, Goldberg and Kripke have been involved in trying to turn the idea into a small screen series since at least 2015, following their deal for Preacher at Sony's TV arm, and had struck a deal at US cable channel Cinemax which didn't end up generating anything. According to Deadline, the show has been in development for a few months at Amazon (which carries Preacher outside the States) and the streaming service has now ordered an initial run of eight episodes. Prolific producer Neal H. Moritz is also involved, with Kripke running the writers' room and Rogen and Goldberg on to direct at least one episode.
